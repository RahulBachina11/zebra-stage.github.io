<p><strong>Beginning with EB 2.0, licensing of Enterprise Browser has changed</strong>. <u><strong>Upgrading to EB 2.0 requires that all licenses be converted to the new model</strong></u>. Licensed apps running on EB 1.8 (and older) are unaffected; existing licenses remain valid.</p>

<p>As always, Enterprise Browser is free to download and use for evaluation purposes. Commercial deployment to devices requires an End-User License issued by Zebra Technologies for each device. Licenses are available for individual devices and for site deployments of 50 devices or more. Both license types permit an unlimited number of Enterprise Browser-based apps to run on the device(s). This guide explains the process of obtaining an Enterprise Browser license for commercial use and applying the license to individual devices and as part of a mass-deployment.</p>

## `TO BE MODIFIED`

If the user wants to enable an entitlement via a pre-activated license, this option should be chosen under Select

License Source drop-down list with the Production Cloud as the Preactivated Source.
The user cannot add any license source under this option.
This option also caters to an enterprise wide license that serves as a pre-activated license for a set of devices
offered to select software SKUs.

To activate a pre-activated license (offline activation) for any of the Zebra Software Products, follow the steps given below:

Start the License Manager application.
Click the floating action button on the Opening/Home screen. This will open the Activation screen as shown in Figure 5.
This page has the following input fields, where the information needs to be added for activating a license:


Note: Always choose the type of the license source under Select License Source option prior to inputting any data in the license field above. 

Select License Source: If the user wants to activate a license offline, then the Pre-activated option has to be chosen under Select License Source drop down list and a pre-activated source has to be chosen under Select "Pre-activated Source" dropdown list as shown in Figure 10.
Select pre-activated Source: The pre-activated source is either the Production Cloud or Tet Cloud which depends on whether the license binary file was downloaded from Production Cloud Portal or Test Cloud Portal.

<br>

ii)                   Local Server: This license source option corresponds to the On-Premise Server setup locally. The user can select Local Server option under Select License Source drop down and then enter the details of the On-Premise Server setup such as the unique URL and the name used to identify the server as shown in Figure 22. This adds a new License Source and will be available for subsequent activations under the Select License Source drop down list.



iii)                 Pre-activated: If the user wants to activate a pre-activated license, this option has to be chosen under Select License Source drop down list and a valid pre-activated source has to be chosen under Select Pre-activated Source dropdown menu as shown in Figure 23. The pre-activated source is either the Production Cloud or Test Cloud which depends on whether the license binary file was downloaded from Production Cloud Portal or Test Cloud Portal. The user cannot add any license source under this option.

The user has the provision to add new license sources of the proxy servers (Production Cloud Through Proxy or Test Cloud Through Proxy), Custom Cloud server (Relay server) and Local (On-Premise Server) server based license sources using the steps mentioned here. Note that all the license sources added by the user are read only. The name of all the license sources added by the user will be displayed in this field below the above three options.

 Enter URL: This input field is displayed only when the user is given the provision to add a new license source. The user has to enter the URL of the license source in this field. This field will also be visible while viewing any user-added license source but will be read only.

## Adding a License Source

("license source addition")

The user has the provision to add a new Proxy Server (Production Proxy/Test Proxy), Custom Server or a Local Server based license source. New License Sources can be added from Activation Page or from Settings Page.

To add a new license source from Activation Page, follow the steps given below:

1)      If the user wants to add a license source which is Proxy to the Production Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Production Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 24.

2)      If the user wants to add a license source which is a Proxy to the Test Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Test Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 26.

3)      If the user wants to add a license source for a Custom Cloud (Relay) Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Custom Cloud as shown in Fig 28.

4)      If the user wants to add a Local license source, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Local Server as shown in Figure 30.

5)      In all the above cases, the user will be prompted to enter a valid server URL and a unique name to identify the license source.

6)      Once valid data is entered in the URL and Name input fields, the license source can be saved by clicking on the Submit button and license source added toast message is displayed to the user on successfully saving the license source.

7)      All the valid license sources added by the user will be displayed in the Select License Source drop down list once they are saved on the device as shown in Figure 32.

8)      Note that all the license sources (Proxy/Custom/Local) added by the user are read only and a maximum of ten license sources can be saved on the device at a time (which includes only the Custom Server and Local Server based license sources) including the default Production Cloud Direct and Test Cloud Direct license sources. Hence the user can add a maximum of eight license sources (can be either Custom license sources only or Local license sources only or combination of both). There is no limit for the Proxy server based license sources.

9)      All the license sources are also displayed in License Sources screen in Settings as shown in Figure 33. New license sources can also be added through License sources screen in Settings as explained here.

Enterprise Browser does not support transferring a pre-activated license. It supports transferring a license from one device to another if and only if license is activated via cloud or LLS. In this case user can return an activated license back to the pool (not applicable for pre-activated license) and released license can be activated on a new device.
To know more about returning a license back to cloud/LLS license pool is explained more here

Enterprise Browser License Screen
Unlicensed Screen
If user has not activated any licenses, user may see an unlicensed screen
If user had activated a trial license and if it has expired, user may see an unlicensed screen.
