Licenses are available for individual devices and for site deployments of 50 devices or more. Both license types permit an unlimited number of Enterprise Browser-based apps to run on the device(s). This guide explains the process of obtaining an Enterprise Browser license for commercial use and applying the license to individual devices and as part of a mass-deployment.</p>

<p>("license source addition")</p>

<p>The user has the provision to add a new Proxy Server (Production Proxy/Test Proxy), Custom Server or a Local Server based license source. New License Sources can be added from Activation Page or from Settings Page.</p>

<p>To add a new license source from Activation Page, follow the steps given below:</p>

<p>1)      If the user wants to add a license source which is Proxy to the Production Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Production Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 24.</p>

<p>2)      If the user wants to add a license source which is a Proxy to the Test Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Test Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 26.</p>

<p>3)      If the user wants to add a license source for a Custom Cloud (Relay) Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Custom Cloud as shown in Fig 28.</p>

<p>4)      If the user wants to add a Local license source, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Local Server as shown in Figure 30.</p>

<p>5)      In all the above cases, the user will be prompted to enter a valid server URL and a unique name to identify the license source.</p>

<p>6)      Once valid data is entered in the URL and Name input fields, the license source can be saved by clicking on the Submit button and license source added toast message is displayed to the user on successfully saving the license source.</p>

<p>7)      All the valid license sources added by the user will be displayed in the Select License Source drop down list once they are saved on the device as shown in Figure 32.</p>

<p>8)      Note that all the license sources (Proxy/Custom/Local) added by the user are read only and a maximum of ten license sources can be saved on the device at a time (which includes only the Custom Server and Local Server based license sources) including the default Production Cloud Direct and Test Cloud Direct license sources. Hence the user can add a maximum of eight license sources (can be either Custom license sources only or Local license sources only or combination of both). There is no limit for the Proxy server based license sources.</p>

<p>9)      All the license sources are also displayed in License Sources screen in Settings as shown in Figure 33. New license sources can also be added through License sources screen in Settings as explained here.</p>
