<h3 id="qwhatislifeguardforandroidlg" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatislifeguardforandroidlg"><span></span></a>Q: What is LifeGuard for Android (LG)?</h3>

<p><strong>A:  LifeGuard for Android (LG) is an operating system security support model for select Zebra Android products</strong> that provides three security value propositions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Extended availability of OS security updates/patches </li>

<li>Security support during OS Transition Periods (OTPs)</li>

<li>Periodic security patches (as frequently as every 30 days) </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<!-- ### Q: Why LG now? 
**A: Enterprise customers now seek the best of both worlds; a full set of both enterprise and consumer features. To deliver on this request requires an OS with significant overall market adoption (Android being the world's #1 OS with approximately 80% share). Though there are significant benefits derived from market success, it also attracts the attention of cyber attackers. Thus, the need for comprehensive security support/updates is more important than ever before.

Below are several quotes from a recent Homeland Security (April 2017) report (“Study on Mobile Security”) accentuating the need for a service like LG: 

1. “The most important defense against mobile device security threats is to ensure devices are patched against the publicly known security vulnerabilities”

2. “When making procurement decisions, enterprises should seek clear commitment from device vendors or mobile carriers that security updates will be provided in a timely manner”

3. “When a device model is no longer supported with updates, enterprises should decommission those devices”

https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20Study%20on%20Mobile%20Device%20Security%20-%20April%202017-FINAL.pdf

Recognize that a “vulnerability” is not the same as an “attack.” Many headline vulnerabilities (e.g. Stagefright) were never actually detected on any devices outside of a research lab.

<h3 id="qwhatsthedifferencebetweenlifeguardandmx" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatsthedifferencebetweenlifeguardandmx"><span></span></a>Q: What's the difference between LifeGuard and MX?</h3>

<p><strong>A: <u><a href="/mx">Zebra Mobility Extensions (MX)</a></u> are enhancements to the Android operating system developed by Zebra that provide enterprise management and security features for Zebra devices used in corporate environments</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>LifeGuard is a security life cycle management system dedicated to delivering OS and security updates and patches for remediating system vulnerabilities and security threats to the core operating system</strong>. </p>

<hr>

<h3 id="qwhyarecertainproductsexcludedfromlg" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhyarecertainproductsexcludedfromlg"><span></span></a>Q: Why are certain products excluded from LG?</h3>

<p><strong>A: Products not covered under full LG support are usually older and built with SoC architecture that is no longer in general use</strong>. Occasionally the reason relates to software contained in the device that is not directly managed by Zebra.</p>

<h3 id="qwhatisapatchlevel" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatisapatchlevel"><span></span></a>Q: What is a Patch Level?</h3>

<p><strong>A: Applying the updates associated with each bulletin will set a “Patch Level” on the device that correlates to the Google published Android Monthly Bulletin</strong>. This information is provided in each individual product’s release notes at its time of release and can be seen on the phone in <strong><code>Settings &gt; About Phone</code></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>The Patch Level provides two dates</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>The device’s most recent full security update </li>

<li>The date the device last received "Critical Only" updates</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, "Patch Level 2016-05-01 Critical 2016-12-01" indicates that the device was last fully patched on May 1, 2016, and received its last critical patch on December 1, 2016. </p>

<h3 id="qhowdoeslghelpcustomersmaintainsecurityduringanostransition" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowdoeslghelpcustomersmaintainsecurityduringanostransition"><span></span></a>Q: How does LG help customers maintain security during an OS transition?</h3>

<p><strong>A: When Zebra releases an OS with a new version of Android, the earlier version remains under support for a period of 12 months</strong>. This is referred to as the OS Transition Period (OTP). During OTP, customers receive updates <code>approximately every three months</code>, with a minimum coverage for all Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs). <u><a href="#qwhatisacve">More</a></u>. </p>

<h3 id="qhowaresecuritypatchesinstalledonadevice" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowaresecuritypatchesinstalledonadevice"><span></span></a>Q: How are security patches installed on a device?</h3>

<p><strong>A: Security patches can generally be installed directly using the Android Debug Bridge (adb) over USB, via external SD card (if supported), or over-the-air</strong> (OTA) using Zebra StageNow or a company's own Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system.</p>

<p><strong>A: Patching decisions are based primarily on <a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin">Android Security Bulletins</a></strong>, whether it's during Google support for an OS release or after Google support ends. After Google support ends, Zebra assesses each vulnerability and determines whether it's possible to develop relevant patches.</p>

<p><code>During this period, certain security vulnerabilities may be systemic, requiring significant changes that would impact the stability and interoperability of the platform of an earlier OS release. In such cases, Zebra cannot guarantee that it will directly remediate every such vulnerability. Therefore, Zebra provides remediation recommendations, but may not provide a code patch/update for such vulnerabilities.</code></p>

<h3 id="qhowdoeslifeguardcomparetowhatwastraditionallyofferedforlegacymicrosoftoses" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowdoeslifeguardcomparetowhatwastraditionallyofferedforlegacymicrosoftoses"><span></span></a>Q: How does LifeGuard compare to what was traditionally offered for legacy Microsoft OSes?</h3>

<p><strong>A: Zebra support for legacy Microsoft OSes while under MS mainstream support is as follows</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Zebra provides engineering support on all of our software (device OS software, EMDK, drivers, etc.) for customers with support contracts (“Supported Customers”). Up until 6 months following the Zebra announced “Last Shipping” date, Zebra will provide Supported Customers with resolutions (ie Hot Fixes) to reported issues. Following that period and up until the Zebra announced “End of Service” date, Zebra will work on a best efforts basis to resolve issues by providing Supported Customers either a workaround or patch/HotFix to Zebra code or may suggest a workaround or change for the customer to implement in their application.</p>
  
  <p>Historically, the majority of reported software issues can be resolved with changes to Zebra owned code or changes to the customer application. For issues in Microsoft code, Zebra currently maintains an OEM support agreement with Microsoft. For those devices with a service life extending beyond Microsoft extended support, Zebra will operate on a best efforts basis to help identify workarounds in either Zebra owned code or 3rd party application code. As Microsoft states on their site, “Microsoft may be unable to provide security updates for older products, leaving them at risk in the face of more demanding security requirements.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time, Zebra cannot state definitively the level of support that the company will receive from Microsoft after extended support <code>has ended?</code>. As stated earlier Zebra will <code>continue it support</code>. </p>

<h3 id="whataretheavailablelifeguardsupportlevels" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#whataretheavailablelifeguardsupportlevels"><span></span></a>What are the available LifeGuard support levels?</h3>

<p><strong>A: There are three LifeGuard support levels</strong>: </p>

<p>L1 is the highest level of support and is provided for the latest OS release for a product while Google is providing security support. L2 has slightly less support (see above) and is provided for older OS versions during an OTP, and for the latest OS during the period after Google stops security support and prior to Zebra's end-of-support (EoS + two (2) years). </p>

<p>L1 - during L1 Zebra provides updates approximately every 30 days. Updates are comprehensive, in that all relevant Android Security Bulletin CVE’s regardless of severity level are addressed. L1 support is provided for the latest current OS release on a product during the period in which Google is providing security support updates. </p>

<p>L2 - during L2 Zebra provides quarterly updates minimally covering all Android Security Bulletin CVE’s posted as “critical.” L2 support is provided during two periods. The first is during an OS Transition Period (OTP). The second is the period after Google has terminated security support and prior to Zebra’s end of security support. </p>

<p>L3 - Products not in either L1 or L2 fall into a Zebra discretionary support window (L3), during which Zebra will make a best effort to address major security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><strong>A: Yes. You can purchase a OneCare service contract inclusive of LG, but additional charges might apply depending on the specific device/OS platform(s) to be covered</strong>.

<p><strong>A: Yes. Zebra offers one-year security support extensions, allowing customers to extend either the end of security support date or the OS Transition Period (OTP)</strong>.</p>

<p>For example; the standard LG security support contract for a 3/3 product is 5 years from first product ship (3+2). This can be extended to six years by purchasing a one-year extension. </p>

<p>Similarly, a customer can extend the standard LG OS Transition Period (OTP), which allows the customers added time (i.e. more than 12 months) to transition between OS releases while still getting security updates.</p>

<p>The scope of the one-year extension is to a specific product model on a specific OS release (identified within the purchase agreement). Support during the extension period is L2 (Quarterly updates /Critical severity). </p>

<p>The agreement only covers security support and does not entitle the customer to general bug fixes or maintenance releases. In some instances, a security patch may be contingent on a bug fix/MR, in which case Zebra will make the necessary bug fix/MR available to the customer.</p>

<p>In many instances these security updates may fall outside of the Google Support window. Though an exception condition, certain security vulnerabilities may be systemic; requiring significant changes that would impact the stability and interoperability of the platform of an earlier OS release. In such cases, Zebra cannot guarantee that it will directly remediate every such vulnerability. Therefore, Zebra will provide remediation recommendations, but may not provide a code patch/update for such vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Under the one-year extension agreement, Zebra will provide limited phone support. Often referred to as “Level 1” escalation this will be relegated to basic question and answers.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this document, the list price for a one-year LG extension is $195K. The latest price/SKU can be found in solution builder by typing “Lifeguard” into the search box. </p>

<p><strong>A: Zebra’s goal is to release within 2-3 days of a public Android security bulletin</strong>. However, updates vary in complexity and scope, are sometimes combined with a maintenance release, and can have dependencies on third-party code that must be obtained separately by Zebra. Therefore, the release of security updates can vary depending on region, product model and third-party software suppliers. </p>

<p>In addition, releases for WWAN devices might lag due to additional testing and/or carrier certification, which can take from 2-6 weeks.

Customers operating in a peak season (and a potential code lockdown) should assess the individual CVEs being addressed in a release and proceed accordingly. Customers might also be using techniques and/or solutions such as Android Lock Task mode, application white-listing or Zebra's <a href="/ehs">Enterprise Home Screen</a> to mitigate some threats, updates will provide an added level of defense and should generally be applied as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>A: No. The apps that comprise Google Mobile Services (GMS) are closed binaries owned by Google and all GMS updates (including security enhancements) are provided by Google</strong>. GMS updates from the Google Play store typically require a Google account (Managed Account or Google Account) on the device, although Google retains the right to updates without an account.</p>

<p><strong>A: Zebra monitors for such events and makes a best effort to respond in relative real time</strong>. When a major vulnerability or attack surfaces between a scheduled update or security bulletin, Zebra addresses the events outside of the standard LG release schedules.</p>

<p><strong>A: Yes. Device(s) must be on the latest maintenance release prior to loading the security update</strong> to allow Zebra to validate the updates. </p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The OS transition period is based on the Android version number; it ignores the API, BSP and maintenance release levels. If a customer wishes to stay on a specific BSP or MR and continue to receive security updates, this would be considered a custom product and is subject to additional charges. <code>Zebra associates must submit a Customer Product Request (CPR).</code></p>

<h3 id="qwhatdoesgoogleofferforsecurityupdatesonpixeldevices" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatdoesgoogleofferforsecurityupdatesonpixeldevices"><span></span></a>Q: What does Google offer for security updates on Pixel devices?</h3>

<p>**A: Google Nexus and Pixel devices are generally the gold standard for consumer grade support. Google provides security support for the later of either 36 months from first ship or 18 months past end-of-sale. In general consumer device life cycles are less than 18 months, so typical support is relegated to the 36 months from first ship. In comparison, a Zebra 5/5 product offers 84 months of support.

<h3 id="qhowcanlgmakezebradevicescompetitiveagainstcompetitorsonanewerosrelease" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowcanlgmakezebradevicescompetitiveagainstcompetitorsonanewerosrelease"><span></span></a>Q: How can LG make Zebra devices competitive against competitors on a newer OS release?</h3>

<p>**A: LG may be a significant differentiator when a Zebra product is compared against a competitive product with a later OS release. For example, under LG Zebra has Android 5.1 (L) products with security support until 2021. A competitive product following Google’s support model would end security support for Android 6.0 (M) in August 2018. Thus, under LG, a customer may be able to obtain 3 additional years of security support (which generally equates to service) on the Zebra Android L device.</p>

<h3 id="qareallzebraandroidproductscoveredunderlg" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qareallzebraandroidproductscoveredunderlg"><span></span></a>Q: Are all Zebra Android products covered under LG?</h3>

<p><strong>A: No. Recently introduced products and some legacy products are fully covered under LG</strong>. Other legacy products may have similar but different security support. </p>

<p>Since end-of-sale dates are not published, this information is for internal use only. The specific, expected LG support duration for a product should only be discussed directly (1:1) with customers and only with prior acknowledgement by the respective product manager.

<h3 id="qisthereastandardlgdescriptionforpmbs" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qisthereastandardlgdescriptionforpmbs"><span></span></a>Q: Is there a standard LG description for PMB’s?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. For products that support LG you can use the following text. </p>

<p>The XXX product family is covered under LifeGuard and includes the following support:</p>

<p>1) Extended Security Service Life - customers receive security updates for 2 years after Zebra’s Device End-of-Sale (EOS). This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time. 
2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable. 
3) Security Support Through OS transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release. 
4) Purchasable One-Year Extensions - Items 1-3 are available at no charge to customers under Zebra OneCare. Should customers wish to extend either the OS Transition Period (OTP) or the overall Security Service Life, Zebra makes available for purchase 1 year security support extensions. These extensions are available to Zebra OneCare customers, and must be purchased at least 90 days prior to the customer OneCare end date. For more Information, refer to the Extended Service request form here.)</p>

<h3 id="qisthereastandardoflgrequirementsforzebradevelopmentsuppliers" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qisthereastandardoflgrequirementsforzebradevelopmentsuppliers"><span></span></a>Q: Is there a standard of LG requirements for Zebra development suppliers?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. This should be used as a guideline; specific developments may have specific additional requirements:</p>

<p>x.x Security Patch 
• Supplier to release monthly security patches with no more than 30-day lag from Google public notification date
• Upon transition to a new Android major release (e.g. N to O), Supplier must provide four quarterly security updates (for one year) on the previous OS (e.g. N) while still providing monthly security patch for e.g. OS “O”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The quarterly updates must include all security patches categorized by Google as “Critical” at a minimum.
    • Once Google stops providing security patches for the Android version on this product (e.g. O), Supplier must back port security patches categorized by Google as “Critical” and release these fixes quarterly with no more than 30-day lag from the last Google security notification.
    • Supplier must continue releasing security patches for 24 months past the end-of-sale of the product
    • Supplier to roll fixes from SPR in to security patch so that Zebra gets one combined patch (i.e. SPR+ Security)
    • Supplier to release Security patches following Zebra guidelines (e.g. OTA versus file based, APA…)
    • Supplier to resolve issues found during system test, AFM, stability and 3PL Google certification
    • Supplier to perform CTS, CTSv and GTS pretest before submitting to 3PL for formal Google certification </p>
