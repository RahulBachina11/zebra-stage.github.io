<h3 id="qwhatislifeguardforandroidlg" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatislifeguardforandroidlg"><span></span></a>Q: What is LifeGuard for Android (LG)?</h3>

<p><strong>A:  LG represents an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products</strong>. LG provides Zebra customers three security value propositions; </p>

<ol>
<li>Extended availability of OS security updates/patches, </li>

<li>Security support during OS transitions (referred to as an “OS Transition Period”)</li>

<li>Periodic security patches as frequent as every 30 days. </li>
</ol>

<p>Though not part of the basic LG support model, customers can separately purchase 1-year security support extensions. </p>

<hr>

<!-- ### Q: Why LG now? 
**A: Enterprise customers now seek the best of both worlds; a full set of both enterprise and consumer features. To deliver on this request requires an OS with significant overall market adoption (Android being the world's #1 OS with approximately 80% share). Though there are significant benefits derived from market success, it also attracts the attention of cyber attackers. Thus, the need for comprehensive security support/updates is more important than ever before.

Below are several quotes from a recent Homeland Security (April 2017) report (“Study on Mobile Security”) accentuating the need for a service like LG: 

1. “The most important defense against mobile device security threats is to ensure devices are patched against the publicly known security vulnerabilities”

2. “When making procurement decisions, enterprises should seek clear commitment from device vendors or mobile carriers that security updates will be provided in a timely manner”

3. “When a device model is no longer supported with updates, enterprises should decommission those devices”

https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20Study%20on%20Mobile%20Device%20Security%20-%20April%202017-FINAL.pdf

Recognize that a “vulnerability” is not the same as an “attack.” Many headline vulnerabilities (e.g. Stagefright) were never actually detected on any devices outside of a research lab.

<h3 id="qwhatisthedifferencebetweenlifeguardandmx" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatisthedifferencebetweenlifeguardandmx"><span></span></a>Q: What is the difference between LifeGuard and MX?</h3>

<p><strong>A: <a href="/mx">Zebra Mobility Extensions (MX)</a> are enhancements to the Android operating system developed by Zebra that provide enterprise management and security features for Zebra devices used in corporate environments</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>LifeGuard is a security life cycle management system dedicated to delivering OS and security updates and patches for remediating system vulnerabilities and security threats to the core operating system</strong>. </p>

<h3 id="qcanendofsaledatesshift" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qcanendofsaledatesshift"><span></span></a>Q: Can end of sale dates shift?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. Zebra generally classifies product hardware into “years available for sale” / “years available for hardware service.” Thus, a 5/5 device can be purchased for 5 years and is available for service for an additional 5 years. </p>

<p>Hardware end-of-sale dates may fluctuate based on market conditions and component availability. Zebra works diligently during component selection to align with the planned hardware life cycle, but we cannot make any guarantees.

<h3 id="qareallzebraandroidproductscoveredunderlgseematrix" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qareallzebraandroidproductscoveredunderlgseematrix"><span></span></a>Q: Are all Zebra Android products covered under LG? (see matrix)</h3>

<p>**A: No. Recently introduced products and some legacy products are fully covered under LG. Other legacy products may have similar but different security support. A complete matrix of Android products and their level of support is included in Appendix A.</p>

<p>Since end-of-sale dates are not published, this information is for internal use only. The specific, expected LG support duration for a product should only be discussed directly (1:1) with customers and only with prior acknowledgement by the respective product manager.

<h3 id="qwhyarecertainproductsexcludedfromlg" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhyarecertainproductsexcludedfromlg"><span></span></a>Q: Why are certain products excluded from LG?</h3>

<p>**A: Products not covered under full LG support are either on an older SoC architecture (e.g. MPA 3 products are based on TI 4430 which has been shipping for nearly 6 years) or contain code that is not directly managed by Zebra and whose suppliers were not contracted for extended security support (i.e. TC55 and MC36).</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="qwhatisapatchlevel" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatisapatchlevel"><span></span></a>Q: What is a patch level?</h3>

<p>**A: Applying the updates associated with each bulletin will set the “Patch Level” on the device which correlates to the Google published Android Monthly Bulletin. This same information is in an individual product’s release notes. The Patch Level provides two dates. The first date is your device’s most recent full security update. The second date is the date your device last received Critical Only updates.
EXAMPLE: Patch Level 2016-05-01 Critical 2016-12-01
The example illustrates that the device was last fully patched in May of 2016 and started receiving critical patches. The last date that Critical patches were applied was December 1 2016.</p>

<p>You can find the patch level on a device by going into Settings &gt;&gt; About Phone</p>

<h3 id="qhowcanlgmakezebradevicescompetitiveagainstcompetitorsonanewerosrelease" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowcanlgmakezebradevicescompetitiveagainstcompetitorsonanewerosrelease"><span></span></a>Q: How can LG make Zebra devices competitive against competitors on a newer OS release?</h3>

<p>**A: LG may be a significant differentiator when a Zebra product is compared against a competitive product with a later OS release. For example, under LG Zebra has Android 5.1 (L) products with security support until 2021. A competitive product following Google’s support model would end security support for Android 6.0 (M) in August 2018. Thus, under LG, a customer may be able to obtain 3 additional years of security support (which generally equates to service) on the Zebra Android L device.</p>

<p>**A: Under LG, when Zebra releases a new OS version (desert release) for a product, we continue to support the earlier version for a period of 12 months. This is referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP). During OTP, customers receive quarterly (exact cadence may fluctuate slightly) updates with a minimum coverage for all “critical” severity CVE’s.</p>

<h3 id="qwhatdoesgoogleofferforsecurityupdatesonpixeldevices" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatdoesgoogleofferforsecurityupdatesonpixeldevices"><span></span></a>Q: What does Google offer for security updates on Pixel devices?</h3>

<p>**A: Google Nexus and Pixel devices are generally the gold standard for consumer grade support. Google provides security support for the later of either 36 months from first ship or 18 months past end-of-sale. In general consumer device life cycles are less than 18 months, so typical support is relegated to the 36 months from first ship. In comparison, a Zebra 5/5 product offers 84 months of support.

<h3 id="qcanireverserollbackapatch" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qcanireverserollbackapatch"><span></span></a>Q: Can I reverse/rollback a patch?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes, you can rollback by installing an earlier patch. The details are as follows.</p>

<p>Patches are incremental. Each patch includes the differential changes required to make the patch and a rollback package. The differential changes are relative to the original baseline image. The Rollback package is used to restore the current device image to the original baseline. The rollback package is executed when a new update is received. </p>

<p>E.g. A device starts with some baseline image. When the first update (Update-1) is loaded, the differential updates are applied and the rollback package is stored. When a subsequent update (Update-2) is loaded, the baseline image is restored using the update-1 rollback, and the update-2 differential updates are then applied. The rollback package for update 2 is stored. You cannot go back to the original BSP unless you reload a full BSP image or theoretically load an update with no differential changes. Note that a factory reset will revert the device to the currently stored image which would include any installed updates. </p>

<p>**A: Yes. Zebra cannot validate security updates on all incremental maintenance/BSP releases, therefore, you must be on the latest maintenance release prior to loading the security update. </p>

<p>This is a point worth emphasizing. LG provides for a transition period (support for an older release) at the dessert level, not at the API level, not at the BSP level or not at any maintenance release level. </p>

<p>Should a customer wish to stay on a specific BSP or MR and continue to receive security updates, then this must be done as a custom product and will incur a respective fee. Zebra associated must submit a Customer Product Request (CPR).</p>

<h3 id="qaftergoogleendssupporthowdoeszebradeterminewhattopatch" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qaftergoogleendssupporthowdoeszebradeterminewhattopatch"><span></span></a>Q: After Google ends support, how does Zebra determine what to patch?</h3>

<p>**A: The principal source for Zebra updates are the Android security bulletins. This is true both during Google support for an OS release and after Google ends support. Thus, post Google support, Zebra assess each vulnerability and determines how to backport relevant patches (if possible).</p>

<p>Note that during this period, certain security vulnerabilities may be systemic; requiring significant changes that would impact the stability and interoperability of the platform of an earlier OS release. In such cases, Zebra cannot guarantee that it will directly remediate every such vulnerability. Therefore, Zebra will provide remediation recommendations, but may not provide a code patch/update for such vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>**A: Zebra support for legacy Microsoft OS’s while under MS mainstream support is as follows:
“Zebra provides engineering support on all of our software (device OS software, EMDK, drivers, etc.) for customers with support contracts (“Supported Customers”). Up until 6 months following the Zebra announced “Last Shipping” date, Zebra will provide Supported Customers with resolutions (ie Hot Fixes) to reported issues. Following that period and up until the Zebra announced “End of Service” date, Zebra will work on a best efforts basis to resolve issues by providing Supported Customers either a workaround or patch/HotFix to Zebra code or may suggest a workaround or change for the customer to implement in their application.
Historically, the majority of reported software issues can be resolved with changes to Zebra owned code or changes to the customer application. For issues in Microsoft code, Zebra currently maintains an OEM support agreement with Microsoft. For those devices with a service life extending beyond Microsoft extended support, Zebra will operate on a best efforts basis to help identify workarounds in either Zebra owned code or 3rd party application code. As Microsoft states on their site, “Microsoft may be unable to provide security updates for older products, leaving them at risk in the face of more demanding security requirements.” https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20556/lifecycle-security-update-policy. At this time we cannot state definitively the level of support that Zebra will receive from Microsoft after extended support. As stated earlier Zebra will continue it support. </p>

<p>**A: It’s hard to put an exact dollar amount on mobile attacks, but in general customers should be concerned with; Disruption of Business, Loss of Productivity, Loss of Privacy, Theft of Information, Legal Liability, Brand/Reputation Damage.</p>

<p>It is critical that customers understand the scope of these attacks. A 2016 attack called DressCode enabled a compromised mobile device to be used as a gateway to corporate back-end servers. Thus, even if customers are not storing significant sensitive data on the mobile device, they should still be diligent with security updates. </p>

<h3 id="qwhatisanandroidsecuritybulletin" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhatisanandroidsecuritybulletin"><span></span></a>Q: What is an Android Security Bulletin?</h3>

<p>**A: Each month (generally early in the month) Google publishes an Android Security Bulletin. Bulletins are labeled by the month in which they were released (January, February…). Google OEM device suppliers (e.g. Zebra) are provided access to the bulletins 30 days prior to the public release. With this notification Google includes patch samples which then must be integrated accordingly into each respective platform. Bulletins include a list of recently discovered Android CVE’s along with their respective “severity” level (e.g. Low to Critical).</p>

<p>In 2016 Google addressed a total 655 vulnerabilities (an average of about 50 per month). 133 of these vulnerabilities were ranked as “severe” (around 11 per month, on average). Note that not all CVEs are relevant to all Android products (some are dependent on specific hardware vendors/components). </p>

<h3 id="qisthereamaximumnumberofoneyearextensionsthatacustomercanprocure" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qisthereamaximumnumberofoneyearextensionsthatacustomercanprocure"><span></span></a>Q: Is there a maximum number of one-year extensions that a customer can procure?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. For OTP, a customer is limited to procuring a single, one-year extension. The extension is only applicable to the final version of software on the respective dessert release.</p>

<p>Customers can purchase up to three, one-year extensions to extend the service life. E.g. a 5 yr product would receive 7 yrs of standard LG support (5+2), and thereafter a customer can procure up to 3 additional one-year extensions for a total of 10 years of security updates. The extension is only applicable to the final version of software on the final dessert release. </p>

<p>Extensions will not be available beyond the hardware service life. Thus, for a 3/3 product, extensions will not be available beyond 6 years. </p>

<p>**A: LG has three support levels; L1, L2, L3. Except where explicitly stated, the scope of all support levels is the Google Android Security bulletins. L1 is the highest level of support and is provided for the latest OS release for a product during the period in which Google is providing security support. L2 has slightly less support and is provided for an older OS during an OS Transition Period, and for the latest OS during the period after Google stops security support and prior to Zebra end of support (EoS + 2 yrs). </p>

<p>L1 - during L1 Zebra provides updates approximately every 30 days. Updates are comprehensive, in that all relevant Android Security Bulletin CVE’s regardless of severity level are addressed. L1 support is provided for the latest current OS release on a product during the period in which Google is providing security support updates. </p>

<p>L2 - during L2 Zebra provides quarterly updates minimally covering all Android Security Bulletin CVE’s posted as “critical.” L2 support is provided during two periods. The first is during an OS Transition Period (OTP). The second is the period after Google has terminated security support and prior to Zebra’s end of security support. </p>

<p>L3 - Products not in either L1 or L2 fall into a Zebra discretionary support window (L3), during which Zebra will make a best effort to address major security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>**A: Yes. Zebra offers 1-year security support extensions. This allows customers to extend either the end of security support date or the OS Transition Period (OTP).</p>

<p>For example; under standard LG security support for a 3/3 product is 5 years from first product ship (3+2). By purchasing a one year extension, a customer can then extend the 5 years by one additional year. </p>

<p>Similarly, a customer can extend the standard LG OS Transition Period (OTP). Extending an OTP allows the customers added time (i.e. more than 12 months) to transition between OS releases while still getting security updates.</p>

<p>The scope of the one-year extension is to a specific product model on a specific OS release (identified within the purchase agreement). Support during the extension period is L2 (Quarterly updates /Critical severity). </p>

<p>The agreement only covers security support and does not entitle the customer to general bug fixes or maintenance releases. In some instances, a security patch may be contingent on a bug fix/MR, in which case Zebra will make the necessary bug fix/MR available to the customer.</p>

<p>In many instances these security updates may fall outside of the Google Support window. Though an exception condition, certain security vulnerabilities may be systemic; requiring significant changes that would impact the stability and interoperability of the platform of an earlier OS release. In such cases, Zebra cannot guarantee that it will directly remediate every such vulnerability. Therefore, Zebra will provide remediation recommendations, but may not provide a code patch/update for such vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Under the one-year extension agreement, Zebra will provide limited phone support. Often referred to as “Level 1” escalation this will be relegated to basic question and answers.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this document, the list price for a one-year LG extension is $195K. The latest price/SKU can be found in solution builder by typing “Lifeguard” into the search box. </p>

<h3 id="qhowlongwillittakezebratoreleaseasecurityupdateafterasecuritybulletin" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qhowlongwillittakezebratoreleaseasecurityupdateafterasecuritybulletin"><span></span></a>Q: How long will it take Zebra to release a security update after a security bulletin?</h3>

<p>**A: Zebra’s goal is to be within 2-3 days of the public Android security bulletin. However, many updates vary in complexity and scope, and have dependencies on third party code that must be obtained by Zebra. Thus, security updates may vary depending on the region, product model, and third party software suppliers. Additionally, releases for WAN (cellular) devices may lag other release due to additional testing and/or carrier certification. Carrier certifications can vary from 2 wks to 6 wks depending on the specific carrier and the extent of required testing. </p>

<p>Note also that an update may be a combination of a maintenance release and a security update. </p>

<p>Finally, because of the lag time in carrier certification it is possible that a carrier certified update may actually have a security patch level earlier than an prior release. Thus, when loading a new, major, carrier certified update, customers should check the patch level and if necessary load the necessary patches. </p>

<h3 id="qdoeszebraadvisecustomerstoinstallallupdates" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qdoeszebraadvisecustomerstoinstallallupdates"><span></span></a>Q: Does Zebra advise customers to install all updates?</h3>

<p>**A: Zebra does advise customers to install all updates in a timely manner. However, we appreciate that all software updates carry some degree of functional risk. Customers operating in a peak season (and a potential code lockdown) may want to assess the individual CVE’s being addressed in a release. Customers may already be using techniques that mitigate many these CVEs (e.g. application white listing, enterprise home screen, lock task mode). Though updates will provide an added level of defense (defense in depth) customers should make an informed decision.</p>

GMS updates (including security enhancements) are provided by Google. GMS updates come from the Google Play Store and typically requires a Google account (Managed Account or Google Account) be present on the device (note: Google has the right to push an update without an account).</p>

<h3 id="qwhataboutzerodayvulnerabilitiesattacks" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qwhataboutzerodayvulnerabilitiesattacks"><span></span></a>Q: What about Zero day vulnerabilities/attacks?</h3>

<p>**A: Occasionally a major vulnerability/attack instantly surfaces. These events cannot be predicted and it is difficult to predict a response time. Zebra does however monitor for such events and makes a best effort to respond in relative real time. In many such instances Zebra will address these events outside of the standard LG release schedules / policies.</p>

<h3 id="qisthereastandardlgdescriptionforpmbs" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qisthereastandardlgdescriptionforpmbs"><span></span></a>Q: Is there a standard LG description for PMB’s?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. For products that support LG you can use the following text. </p>

<p>The XXX product family is covered under LifeGuard and includes the following support:</p>

<p>1) Extended Security Service Life - customers receive security updates for 2 years after Zebra’s Device End-of-Sale (EOS). This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time. 
2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable. 
3) Security Support Through OS transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release. 
4) Purchasable One-Year Extensions - Items 1-3 are available at no charge to customers under Zebra OneCare. Should customers wish to extend either the OS Transition Period (OTP) or the overall Security Service Life, Zebra makes available for purchase 1 year security support extensions. These extensions are available to Zebra OneCare customers, and must be purchased at least 90 days prior to the customer OneCare end date. For more Information, refer to the Extended Service request form here.)</p>

<h3 id="qisthereastandardoflgrequirementsforzebradevelopmentsuppliers" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#qisthereastandardoflgrequirementsforzebradevelopmentsuppliers"><span></span></a>Q: Is there a standard of LG requirements for Zebra development suppliers?</h3>

<p>**A: Yes. This should be used as a guideline; specific developments may have specific additional requirements:</p>

<p>x.x Security Patch 
• Supplier to release monthly security patches with no more than 30-day lag from Google public notification date
• Upon transition to a new Android major release (e.g. N to O), Supplier must provide four quarterly security updates (for one year) on the previous OS (e.g. N) while still providing monthly security patch for e.g. OS “O”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The quarterly updates must include all security patches categorized by Google as “Critical” at a minimum.
    • Once Google stops providing security patches for the Android version on this product (e.g. O), Supplier must back port security patches categorized by Google as “Critical” and release these fixes quarterly with no more than 30-day lag from the last Google security notification.
    • Supplier must continue releasing security patches for 24 months past the end of sale of the product
    • Supplier to roll fixes from SPR in to security patch so that Zebra gets one combined patch (i.e. SPR+ Security)
    • Supplier to release Security patches following Zebra guidelines (e.g. OTA versus file based, APA…)
    • Supplier to resolve issues found during system test, AFM, stability and 3PL Google certification
    • Supplier to perform CTS, CTSv and GTS pretest before submitting to 3PL for formal Google certification </p>
