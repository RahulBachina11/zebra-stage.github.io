<p>The Access Manager (AccessMgr) enables an admin to configure a device to control which user or "installable" application(s) can be used on the device and what actions the application(s) can perform. </p>

<p>A key feature of AccessMgr is the ability to enable and disable "whitelisting," a process that allows only those applications explicitly specified in a list to run. <strong>Whitelisting is disabled by default</strong> and imposes no restrictions. When whitelisting is turned on, various restrictions can be applied using AccessMgr. Applications <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> included in the "whitelist" are prevented from running. AccessMgr allows whitelist applications to be installed, launched and maintained, and can control which applications are allowed to submit XML for all CSPs, including AccessMgr itself.</p>

<p>Whitelisting applies only to user applications and has no effect on System applications, which are applications built into the device and are therefore always present. To control aspects of System applications, see [AppMgr]../appmgr.</p>

<p>User applications are those <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> built into the device and hence must be installed before they can be used. Whitelisting can be used to control whether a device user is allowed to install a user application, but cannot control whether an application can be installed programmatically by using AppMgr. Whitelisting also can be used to control whether a user application can be launched (by any means) once it is installed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to understand that if a user application uses AccessMgr to turn on whitelisting, then that application will become subject to whitelisting. If the application does not add itself to the "white" list, then that application will no longer be allowed to run. Also, if such an application does not explicitly allow itself to submit XML, then it would not be able to alter the configuration once it was successfully applied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AccessMgr also provides the option to control whether the device user can access a full or reduced version of the in-device Settings panel.</p>
