        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Whitelisting, which restricts the apps that a device user can install and/or launch. <strong>Whitelisting is Off by default</strong>, imposing no restrictions. Whitelisting provides device security by preventing the installation and/or use of unauthorized apps, and by complicating the process of app deployment.</p>
