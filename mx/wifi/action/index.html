        <p>This is the On-Off switch for the Wi-Fi radio. <strong>Note: Wi-Fi must be enabled to change some other Wi-Fi settings</strong>, including those controlled by the Network Actions parameter described later in this document. Attempting to change such settings while the Wi-Fi radio is disabled will result in an error. Zebra recommends beginning any profile created to change Wi-Fi settings with a command to enable the Wi-Fi radio. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the Wi-Fi configuration service provider, the terms "enable" and "disable" refer to the ability by a user or administrator to "turn on" and "turn off" a feature or capability. In some other CSPs, those terms refer to the feature's "Usage" setting, which can prevent access to the feature entirely. </p>
