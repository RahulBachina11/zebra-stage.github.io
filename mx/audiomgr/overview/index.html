        <p>The Audio Manager (AudioMgr) controls whether audio on the device plays audio only through the built-in speaker, through a connected headset or through both. It was developed for the Zebra VC80x vehicle-mount computer, which has a custom port for attaching a Zebra M1000 headset. When the headset is not being worn, its speaker volume might be difficult to hear and lead to missed communications. AudioMgr was designed to combat this issue; it can be used to force audio normally sent only to the M1000 speaker to be replicated on the VC80x's built-in speaker.</p>
