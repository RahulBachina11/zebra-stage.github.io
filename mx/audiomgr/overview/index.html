        <p>The Audio Manager (AudioMgr) controls whether audio on a device plays audio only through the built-in device speaker, through a connected handset, or through both. This feature was developed for the VC80x vehicle-mount computer, which has a custom port for attaching the Zebra M1000 handset. AudioMgr can force audio normally sent only to the M1000 speaker to be replicated on the VC80x's built-in speaker. This addresses the issue of missed communications that can arise when the handset is not being worn. </p>
