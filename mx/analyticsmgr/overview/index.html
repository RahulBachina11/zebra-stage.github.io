        <p>The AnalyticsMgr controls collection of data by the Analytics Engine in the form of groups of metrics.</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices are equipped with an Analytics Engine that can collect information pertaining to the operation and health of a device. Such data can be used to detect devices that need attention or potentially could be used to detect trends that could allow problems to be prevented through preventative action.</p>

<p>AnalyticsMgr also controls which data is collected and how often, and whether collected data is stored on the device or in the Cloud.</p>
