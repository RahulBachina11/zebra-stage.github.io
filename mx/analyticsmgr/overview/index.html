        <p>The AnalyticsMgr controls collection of data on a device by the Analytics Engine in the form of feature groups and individual metrics. AnalyticsMgr controls which data metrics are collected, how often and under what conditions, and whether collected data is stored on the device or in the cloud.</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices are equipped with an Analytics Engine that can collect information pertaining to the operation and health of a device and its battery, radios and other components. Such data can be used to detect devices in need of maintenance, are vulnerable to a security threat, or require other attention or preventative action to maintain optimal performance and avoid failures. </p>
