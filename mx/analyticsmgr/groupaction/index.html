        <p>This parm allows you to decide whether you want to configure which groups of metrics will be collected by the Analytics Engine and how frequently they are collected.</p>

<p>The setting of one or more groups would not affect any other group that is not selected. Also, previously selected settings would be retained on the device. For example, the Analytics CSP could be used to collect WWAN Performance metrics and the other groups could be set to "Do not change". Then at another time, the CSP could be used to collect WLAN Performance metrics and the other groups could be set to "Do not change". Both WWAN and WLAN Performance metrics would then be set to collect data.</p>
