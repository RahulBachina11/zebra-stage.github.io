        <p>Controls data collection of generic metrics associated with a device, such as the number of times it has been dropped, applications that stop responding and the frequency of access to features such as Bluetooth, NFC and Wi-Fi. Also controlled here is the ability to limit updates of the Analytics Engine to Wi-Fi connections only, and to allow other apps on the device to use the Analytics Manager infrastructure for uploading data to the Zebra Cloud. Prior to transport, data to be uploaded is encrypted with an RSA-AES hybrid and compressed using gzip. The Custom field permits a user-built data collection agent from 1-64 characters to be specified. </p>
