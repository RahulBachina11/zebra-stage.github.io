        <p>Used to apply or remove a Software License on a legacy Symbol device. Applying a Software License on a device for an associated Software Component (that requires licensing) makes the specific capabilities of that Software Component usable on that device. Removing a Software License from a device for a Software Component makes the controlled capability of the associated Software Component unusable on that device or limits its features. <strong>Note: The license removal action deletes the licence from the private store only; the license <em>file</em> still exists on the device and must be deleted separately</strong>.</p>
