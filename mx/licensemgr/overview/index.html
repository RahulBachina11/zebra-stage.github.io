        <p>The License Manager (LicenseMgr) administers the software licenses on a device, allowing an administrator or application on the device to control the usability of software features that require licensing. Software components can be made usable, unusable or feature-limited based on the license on the device. If a component requires licensing, the absence of a valid license will limit or prevent its functionality. Software components that to not require licensing are not effected by this CSP. </p>

<h3 id="licenseacquisition" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenseacquisition"><span></span></a>License Acquisition</h3>

<p>Software licenses are acquired from a Zebra Software License Server are issued as Software License Files and are associated with specific software components through the use of Licensed Feature Names. A Software License File can be used only to enable use of its associated Licensed Feature Name. A component can have multiple capabilities, each controlled through separate Licensed Feature Names. Alternatively, a component can have all of its capabilities controlled through a single Licensed Feature Name.</p>

<p>Software Licenses acquired from a Zebra Software License Server may be Individual Device Licenses, with each Software License File tied to a specific device serial number. In such cases, it is necessary to apply the right Software License File to each matching device. The Zebra Software License Server also provides Enterprise Licenses, which are issued to all devices owned by an enterprise. In such cases, the same Software License File can be applied to each device owned by that enterprise.</p>

<h3 id="licenseverification" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenseverification"><span></span></a>License Verification</h3>

<p>Software License Files are acquired from the Zebra Software License Server, stored locally or online and referenced through the LicenseMgr. However, the sever does not verify whether such files are matched to a particular Licensed Feature. If a valid Software License File is wrongly applied to Licensed Feature other than the intended feature, that feature will not be enabled and no error will result.</p>

<p>To prevent this scenario, Zebra recommends using the <a href="#verificationmethod">Verification Method</a> parameter to verify that Licensed Feature Name(s) match those contained in the Software License File(s). This will cause an error to be returned in the Result XML in the event of a mismatch.</p>
