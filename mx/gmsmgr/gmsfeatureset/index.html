<blockquote>
  <p><strong><code>IMPORTANT</code> <u>Before upgrading a device to MX 8.3 (or later) to gain access to "GMS Restricted" mode</u>: <br>
  If apps were previously disabled using the "DisableGMSApps" App Manager Action, they must be re-enabled using the "EnableGMSApps" App Manager Action prior to a system upgrade</strong>. Failure to do so can result in unpredictable behavior.<br><br>
  <strong><code>NOTE:</code></strong> <strong>It is NOT possible to transition a device to a new OS <em><u>and</u></em> to implement GMS Restricted mode with the same XML profile</strong>.</p>
