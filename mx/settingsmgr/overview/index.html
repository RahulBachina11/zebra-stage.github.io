        <p>The Settings Manager (SettingsMgr) controls access to specific device capabilities in the Android System Settings panel. This allows administrators to prevent device users from changing settings that are sensitive in nature or could lead to undesired results. See <a href="../../.././mx/accessmgr">AccessMgr</a> for other Settings panel feature restrictions. Use <a href="../../../../mx/appmgr">AppMgr</a> to prevent access to the Settings panel altogether. </p>
