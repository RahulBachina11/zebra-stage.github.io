        <p>Used to apply Touch-Mode settings to any supported device in accordance with the touch-screen sensitivity required for an expected usage scenario.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Use this parameter only when no device-specific parameter exists for a target device <u><em><strong>and</strong></em> it is known that touch-screen sensitivity settings are supported on that device</u>. Applying this parameter to a device that does not support touch-screen sensitivity settings returns an error in the Result XML. </p>
