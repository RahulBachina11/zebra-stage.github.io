        <p>Each Key State Mapping Table has its own Advanced Section via which you can specify Key State Modifiers that will be set into the Current Key State when a Key Code is sent as the Key Behavior for the specified Key in that Key State Mapping Table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This parm allows you to choose whether or not to use the Advanced section for a Key Mapping Table. All Advanced parms use the same values shown in the following table of values.</p>
