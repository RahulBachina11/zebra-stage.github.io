        <p>Used to specify whether testing for Boolean, Integer or String data on the device. Regardless of the data type, all condition tests must ultimately yield a Boolean value--some result that is either true or false. The Boolean Data Type, such as whether a device has a valid IP address, provides a direct result and therefore requires no additional parameter. To arrive at a Boolean value when testing Integers and Strings requires one of the relevant condition tests such as "greater-than" for numeric values or "contains" for a specified string. For example, the test of whether a device is an MC40 would look for a string in the Device Model field that contains the constant "MC40" and if so, return a "true" result. <strong>Note: The Source Types and System Values will vary depending on the selected Data Type</strong>.</p>
