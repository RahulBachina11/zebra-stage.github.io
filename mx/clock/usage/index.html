<p>We want to set local time of the device as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Device Location = New York, New York, USA</li>

<li>Date = January 15, 2010</li>

<li>Time = 2:15PM (14:15:00)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can then make the following observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Device Location is in the Eastern USA Time Zone</li>

<li>The GMT offset for that Time Zone is -5 hours</li>

<li>That Time Zone does not observe Daylight Time on that Date</li>
</ul>

<p>The values specified to the Clock would therefore be:</p>

<ul>
<li>TimeZone = "America/New_York"</li>

<li>Date = "2010-01-15"</li>

<li>Time = "19:15:00"</li>
</ul>

<p>The above UTC values would be converted to the desired LTC by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Applying the GMT offset for the selected Time Zone, which is -5 hours (-5 or -05:00)


<ul>
<li>19:15:00 - 05:00 = 14:15:00</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Applying Daylight Saving Time offset, since it is not in effect in that Time Zone on that Date


<ul>
<li>Daylight Saving Time began March 14, 2010</li>

<li>Daylight Saving Time ended November 7, 2019</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Applying no Date offset, since the Time offset did not cause "roll over" or "roll under"</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example2" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#example2"><span></span></a>Example #2</h3>

<p>We want to set the local time of the device as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Device Location = Bangalore, India</li>

<li>Date = July 11, 2014</li>

<li>Time = 2:55AM (02:00:00)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can then make the following observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Device Location is in the India Time Zone</li>

<li>The GMT offset for that Time Zone is +5 1/2 hours (+05:00)</li>

<li>That Time Zone does not observe Daylight Time</li>
</ul>

<p>The values specified to the Clock would therefore be:</p>

<ul>
<li>TimeZone = "Asia/Calcutta"</li>

<li>Date = "2010-07-10"</li>

<li>Time = "21:25:00"</li>
</ul>

<p>The above UTC values would be converted to the desired LTC by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Applying the GMT offset for the selected Time Zone, which is +5 1/2 hours (+05:30)


<ul>
<li>21:25:00 + 05:30 = 26:55:00 = 02:55:00 + 1 day</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Applying no Daylight Saving Time offset


<ul>
<li>India does not observe Daylight Saving Time</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Applying a +1 day Date offset, since the Time offset caused a "roll over"


<ul>
<li>26:55:00 = 02:55:00 +1 day</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
