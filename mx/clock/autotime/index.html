        <p>This parm allows you to control whether the Date and Time on the device should be set automatically or manually.</p>

<p>When AutoTime is turned On, the time will be acquired automatically, if possible. For devices operating on a Cellular network, AutoTime will typically cause the Date and Time to be from the carrier network and set on the device. For other devices, AutoTime will cause a specified NTP server to be automatically contacted on a specified interval and the Date and Time of the device to be set based on the UTC received from that server.</p>

<p>When AutoTime is turned Off, the Date, Time, and Time Zone can be set explicitly and will count forward unless/until explicitly changed again.</p>
