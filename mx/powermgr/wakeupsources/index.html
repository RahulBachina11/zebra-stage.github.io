        <p>Used to control the button-presses that wake the device from suspend mode. <strong>Supported devices by default wake only when the power button is pressed</strong>. Enabling this parameter (option 1) adds the push-to-talk (PTT) button (on the left side of the device) and scan buttons as wake-up sources. <strong>To control individual buttons, see the Wake-up Individual Action parameter.</strong></p>

<!-- 9/11/19- per eng: 
With MX 9.2, this parm will be supported on TC7x and TC5x devices too.

So...

1. Make the note something like "info: On devices with MX versions prior to 9.2, supported on TC20/TC25 devices only." (obviously added the TC7x part too). 
2. Don't forget to update the devicetype: field.
