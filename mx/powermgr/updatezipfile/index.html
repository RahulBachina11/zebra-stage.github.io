        <p>Used to specify the path and filename of the file to be consumed when updating the device using the OS Update Reset Action. The desired OS Update ZIP file must be transferred to the device and stored in a supported location in the device file system before an OS Update can be initiated.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The update file must be present on the device at the time of the Reset Action, and must be stored in a location according to the rules and table below. <strong>Location rules and characteristics vary by device</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="androidlocationrules" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#androidlocationrules"><span></span></a>Android Location Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Update file location must not be blocked</strong> by <a href="../sdcardmgr">SdCardMgr</a> or any other means. </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Removable media must be physically present</strong>. Storage partitions implemented on a removable medium such as a Micro SD Card must be inserted in the device when the Reset Action is initiated. </p></li>

<li><p><strong>The location must not be encrypted</strong>. A location that is encrypted cannot be used for OS Updates. For example, if Full Storage Card Encryption is enabled for a particular Storage Card, that card contains no suitable locations for OS Updates. Similarly, if an Encrypted File System was mounted on a Storage Card, that card also would be unsuitable for OS Updates.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The update entity must have write permissions</strong> in the update file location. </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Emulated Storage Cards are not supported on Jelly Bean</strong>. This limitation does not apply to devices running KitKat and higher.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The path specified using this parameter would normally be the same as the path to which the file was written when it was transferred to the device. However, path names can sometimes appear to be different while ending at the same destination, and it's possible that some such paths will fail to initiate an OS Update when specified using this parameter. Therefore, <strong>Zebra recommends using paths in the following table when specifying the OS Update file to the PowerMgr</strong>.</p>
