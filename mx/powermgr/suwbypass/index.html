        <p>Controls whether to bypass the "Android device setup wizard" (also known as the "Welcome Screen") following an Enterprise Reset initiated through PowerMgr. <strong>Applies only on devices with Google Mobile Services (GMS) and <u>only when Enterprise Reset is initiated by PowerMgr</u></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Important: The bypass setting does not persist on the device following an Enterprise Reset</strong>. If SUW bypass is desired following an Enterprise Reset, this parameter must be included and set to "true" in the same Profile that is used to initiate the Enterprise Reset. The bypass flag was intended to be available as an option ONLY when Enterprise Reset is selected. However, <strong>MX 7.1 and 7.2 allow SUW bypass to be configurable regardless of the Enterprise Reset parameter setting</strong>. Once pushed to such devices, a bypass flag value of "true" will persist until an Enterprise Reset is executed or the flag is changed to "false" by a subsequent profile.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once running, the setup wizard can be exited <strong>on some devices</strong> by scanning a barcode. <a href="/stagenow/latest/Profiles/wipedevice/#setupwizardmanualbypass">More info</a>. </p>
