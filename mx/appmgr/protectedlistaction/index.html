        <p>The Protected List is a feature that allows certain applications to be exempted from certain constraints that are imposed on applications when Multi-User Mode is enabled. In particular, applications whose Package Names are on the Protected List will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be allowed to launch when no device user is logged in</li>

<li>Not be terminated when a device user logs out</li>

<li>Have only one copy of its data for all users, even if Multi-User Data Separation is enabled</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr currently does not support enabling Multi-User Mode. Multi-User Mode can be enabled on devices that support it, but only using unsupported tools or mechanisms that do not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr to manage the Protected List may provide little or no immediate benefit. In the future, when the AccessMgr is enhanced to support enabling Multi-User Mode, the ability to use the AppMgr to manage the Protected List will likely be more meaningful.</p>
