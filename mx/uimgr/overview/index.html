        <p>The UiMgr provides control of miscellaneous UI configuration settings, such as Clipboard behavior.</p>

<p>Android devices contain a variety of UI elements spread throughout the OS and many different System Applications. In some cases, one or more of these "standard" UI elements may be undesireable for devices deployed in Enterprise situations or may be thought to hinder the productivity of device users engaged in specific business tasks.</p>

<p>The UiMgr provides control over these various UI elements as requested by various customers because the default Android behaviors were deemed unacceptable or less than optimal.</p>
