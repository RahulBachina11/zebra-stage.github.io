        <p>The UiMgr provides control of miscellaneous UI configuration settings, such as those for language and locale, the notification pulldown, default input device and Clipboard behavior.</p>

<p>Android devices contain a variety of System applications with UI elements spread throughout the OS. In some cases, one or more of these "standard" UI elements are undesireable for devices deployed in Enterprise situations, or may be thought to hinder the productivity of device users engaged in specific business tasks. </p>

<p>The UiMgr provides control over these various UI elements as requested by various customers because the default Android behaviors were deemed unacceptable or inadequate.</p>
