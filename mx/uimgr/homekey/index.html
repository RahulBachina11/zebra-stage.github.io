        <p>Used to prevent use of the HOME key to exit the current app and run the Home Screen app. This might be desirable when the device is used for a single application, such as a kiosk. By preventing the use of the HOME key, a common method of navigating away from the application (whether intentional or not) can be eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Enabling this parameter does not affect the "long press" behavior of the HOME key. To completely prevent all HOME key functionality, use the KeyMappingMgr (on supported devices) to disable the HOME key or map it to some other behavior.</p>
