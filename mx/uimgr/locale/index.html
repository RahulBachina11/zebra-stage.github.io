        <p>This parm value allows you to set the device's current locale. A locale is a combination of a language and a region where that language is spoken. Languages are identified by two lower cases letters and regions are identified by two upper case letters. The language and region are separated by an underscore ("_") character. For example, "en_US" is the locale specification for "English spoken in the United States of America" and "fr_FR" is the locale specification for "French spoken in France".</p>
