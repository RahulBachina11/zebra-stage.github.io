        <p>This parm allows you to specify that the clipboard should be immediately cleared. This would erase anything that was previously copied to the clipboard. If use of the Clipboard function is allowed, then it might be advisable on exit from any screen that requires the entry of sensitive information to clear the clipboard. This would ensure that such information could not later be pasted into another application.</p>
