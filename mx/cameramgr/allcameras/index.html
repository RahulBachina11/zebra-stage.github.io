        <p>This parm will enable or disable use of all of the cameras that are on the device, which may affect cameras that are not explicitly listed. In other words, this will globally allow or disallow all camera support.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Enabling or disabling all cameras will affect all mechanism that are considered cameras that are supported on a device. This will be the case even if that device has more cameras than can be individually controlled on that device using the CameraMgr. For example, if a device had a front facing camera, a rear facing, and a side-facing imager that can capture documents, all three would be considered cameras would be enabled or disabled together. This would be the cases even the side facing imager could not be enabled or disabled individually. Enabling or disabling all cameras may override prior enabling or disabling of individual cameras using the CameraMgr or may be overridden for individual cameras by subsequent use of the CameraMgr.</p>
