        <p>Controls whether a screen lock will be invoked when the device powers up or user inactivity exceeds the Screen-Lock Timeout Interval parameter, and which Android lock screen will be displayed. </p>

<p><strong><code>NOTE FOR EHS ADMINS:</code></strong> Installation of <a href="/ehs">Zebra Enterprise Home Screen</a> disables the Android Settings panel on devices by default, which causes any execution of this parameter to fail. To use this parameter on devices that will be running EHS, <strong>Zebra recommends setting the ScreenLockType <em><u>before</u></em> EHS is installed on target device(s)</strong>. To set the ScreenLockType on devices already running EHS, enable EHS <a href="https://techdocs.zebra.com/ehs/latest/guide/features/#privilegedsettings">Privileged Settings</a> on those devices to temporarily activate the Settings app, set ScreenLockType as desired, then disable Privileged Mode to re-secure the device." </p>
