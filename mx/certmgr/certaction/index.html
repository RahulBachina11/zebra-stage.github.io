        <p>Used to specify whether to initialize the Android Keystore, Install a Certificate, or Uninstall a Certificate. </p>

<p><strong>Note: Initializing the Android Keystore can be done only once</strong>. If an attempt is made to Initialize the Android Keystore when it has previously been initialized (via the CertMgr or the device user through the System Settings Menu), an error will be returned in the Result XML. Aside from an Enterprise Reset (performed using the <a href="../powermgr">Power Manager</a>), no method is currently provided to re-initialize the Android Keystore or to return it to an uninitialized state.</p>
