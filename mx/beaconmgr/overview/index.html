        <p>Beacon Manager (BeaconMgr) controls the signal transmitted by the <strong>secondary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio of <u><a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/device-tracker.html">supported devices</a></u></strong> when powered off. This beacon can be detected by an app on a device and used as a means of locating other devices. <strong>Beacon Manager facilitates administrative control over beacon contents and settings</strong>, such as transmission power and interval, which can help balance battery consumption with detectable range. </p>

<p>One solution that leverages beaconing technology is Zebra Device Tracker, an Android utility that can help locate misplaced devices by honing in on their BLE beacons. See <a href="https://techdocs.zebra.com/devicetracker">Zebra Device Tracker</a> for more information about configuring the secondary BLE for use with Device Tracker.</p>

<h3 id="batterybasedblebehavior" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#batterybasedblebehavior"><span></span></a>Battery-based BLE Behavior</h3>

<p><strong>The BLE radio of some devices is located in the battery</strong>. Such devices are subject to the behaviors listed below. </p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration settings are stored in the battery and applied only when the mobile device is powered on.</li>

<li>When BLE beaconing is enabled and device is powered off, the battery emits a beacon using the preconfigured values as long as the battery remains in the device.</li>

<li>The BLE radio does NOT emit a beacon if the battery is removed from the device. </li>

<li>If beaconing is enabled and the battery is removed from a device, the battery consumes a small amount of power to periodically detect whether it's in a powered-off device. </li>

<li>If a BLE-enabled and configured battery is placed into a device when the device is powered off, beaconing resumes within about 30 seconds according to the following: 


<ul>
<li>If the battery was configured in that device, the battery's last-saved values are used.</li>

<li>If the battery is placed in a device other than the one in which it was configured, the BLE settings of the new device are applied to the newly inserted battery.</li>

<li>If the battery is placed in a device that contains no Beacon Manager configuration information, the battery behaves according to its last preconfigured values.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
