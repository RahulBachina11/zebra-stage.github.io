        <p>Beacon Manager (BeaconMgr) controls the signal transmitted by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio of a powered-off device to help locate the device using Zebra Device Tracker, a software utility running on a second device. See section below for more information.  </p>

<p>Beacon Manager provides administrative control of beacon contents as well as the interval and power level of the transmitted signal to help balance power consumption with detectable range. </p>

<p><a href="#zebradevicetracker">Zebra Device Tracker</a> is a utility app for Android that detects the non-connectible advertising packets sent by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio of devices being tracked. A device's BLE settings can be configured using Beacon Manager, a component of Zebra's mobility extensions (MX) framework for Android.    </p>

 <em>The Zebra Device Tracker user interface</em>.<br></p>

<p>Device Tracker is preinstalled on some Zebra devices running Android 8.x Oreo (or later) and is available as a download for other devices. Learn more <a href="/devicetracker">about Zebra Device Tracker</a> including <a href="https://techdocs.zebra.com/devicetracker/latest/guide/about/#supporteddevices">supported devices and Android versions</a>. </p>

<h4 id="recommendedsettings" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#recommendedsettings"><span></span></a>Recommended Settings</h4>

<p>Zebra recommends the following Beacon Manager settings for optimal performance when using Device Tracker: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beaconing</strong>: Turn ON</li>

<li><strong>Beaconing in Airplane Mode</strong>: Turn ON</li>

<li><strong>Beacon type</strong>: AltBeacon</li>

<li><strong>Explicit Beacon UUID (checkbox)</strong>: Unchecked</li>

<li><strong>AltBeacon ID1</strong>: EBEB</li>

<li><strong>AltBeacon ID2</strong>: ECDD</li>

<li><strong>Transmission (Tx) Power Level</strong>: High (1 dBm)</li>

<li><strong>Transmission (Tx) Interval</strong>: Low Latency (100 ms)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="airplanemodeoption" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#airplanemodeoption"><span></span></a>Airplane Mode Option</h4>

<p>When a device is placed in Airplane Mode, all device radios are switched off, including the device's beacon emitter. If a device is powered off while in Airplane Mode, the setting contained in the Beaconing Airplane Mode parameter comes into play. Device behavior for this mode is as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>If "Turn On" is selected</strong>, a beacon is emitted when the device is turned off until the device battery runs out or the device is powered on again. </p></li>

<li><p><strong>If "Turn Off" is selected</strong>, no beacon is emitted when the device is turned off until Airplane Mode is turned off, regardless of device's power state.<br><strong><code>IMPORTANT:</code> If this option is selected, <u>Device Tracker might be unable to locate the device by its beacon</u></strong>. </p></li>
</ul>
