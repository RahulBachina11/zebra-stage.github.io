        <p>Controls whether the battery is charged in Long Runtime mode or Extended Cycle Life mode. Long Runtime mode is the current standard for most device chargers, and is designed to maximize device runtime while on battery power. Extended Cycle Life mode charges at a slightly lower voltage than Long Runtime mode, and stops charging before the maximum charge level is reached, extending the usable life of the battery over time. </p>
