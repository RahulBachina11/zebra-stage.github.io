<h1>Operating Modes</h1>
<p>Cloud Connect for RFID provides the ability to configure the radio to different modes of operation that optimize the radio configuration based on intended use case. Once configured, the mode can be started using the START REST API and will continue to operate until the STOP REST API is called. </p>
<p>Note about custom modes ... and link to schema</p>
<p>The following modes are supported in Cloud Connect for RFID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Inventory</li>
<li>Portal</li>
<li>Conveyor</li>
<li>Bearing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simple</h2>
<p>Simple mode configures the radio to read and report all unique tags in the field of view of the radio.</p>
<p>By default:
- The radio attempts to read tags on all antennas. This can be adjusted using the Antennas object when
setting the mode.
- The radio reports all unique tags. This can be adjusted using the Filter object when setting the mode.</p>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>Inventory mode configures the radio to read tags and report all unique tags for each antenna on a periodic interval. Additional meta-data (i.e. peak RSSI and number of reads for each antenna during the interval) is reported.</p>
<p>By default:
- The radio attempts to read tags on all antennas. This can be adjusted using the Antennas object when setting the mode.
- The radio reports tags every minute. This can be adjusted using the <strong><em>Interval</em></strong> object when setting the mode.</p>
<h2>Portal</h2>
<p>Portal mode configures the radio to report all unique tags that pass by each antenna immediately following a GPI event. The GPI event signals the beginning of the read period. As soon as the GPI event triggers the radio, the radio continues to read tags until no new unique tags are read for a configurable stop interval. Once the radio stops reading tags, it waits for the next GPI event to start the process again.</p>
<p>By default:
- The radio attempts to read tags on all antennas. This can be adjusted using the Antennas object when setting the mode.
- The radio reports all unique tags once per trigger. This can be adjusted using the Filter object when setting the mode.
- The radio waits for a LOW signal on GPI 1. This can be adjusted using the StartTrigger object when setting the mode.
- The radio continues to read until no new unique tags have been read for 3 seconds. This can be adjusted using the StopInterval object when setting the mode.</p>
<h2>Conveyor</h2>
<p>Conveyor mode configures the radio to read tags and report all unique tags for each antenna.</p>
<p>By default:
- The radio attempts to read tags on all antennas. This can be adjusted using the Antennas object when setting the mode.
- The radio reports each unique tags once per antenna. This can be adjusted using the Filter object when setting the mode.</p>
