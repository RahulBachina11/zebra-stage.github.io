# Introduction

Cloud Connect for RFID provides cloud-based management, control, and RFID tag data collection for Zebra's fixed RFID reader portfolio (FX7500, FX9600, and ATR7000). The Cloud Connect for RFID feature enables connectivity to a cloud platform to provide IoT capabilities to the reader. Once connected, the readers can be managed and controlled using a REST API interface; while tag data can be pushed to an asynchronous consumer of choice.
