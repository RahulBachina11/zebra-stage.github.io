  "description": "Controls when and how often a tag is reported\n\n  “ANTENNA” will report the antenna port upon which the tag was inventoried.\n\n  “RSSI” will report the rssi (in dbm) of the inventoried tag. If the tag is only reported occasionally (see reportFilter), this tag will be the peak rssi since the last reported read. \n  \n  \"PHASE” will report the phase (in degrees) of the inventoried tag. This value will only be reported if each individual tag read is reported (in other words, if reportFilter duration is set to 0). Otherwise, it will not be reported.\n  \n  \"CHANNEL” will report the channel (in MHz) the reader was using when the tag was inventoried. This value will only be reported if each individual tag read is reported (in other words, if reportFilter duration is set to 0). Otherwise, it will not be reported.\n  \n  “SEEN_COUNT” will report the number of times the tag has been inventoried since the previous report. This value will always be 1 if each individual tag read is reported (in other words, if reportFilter duration is set to 0). \n  \n  \"PC\" will report the PC bits of the inventoried tag as a hex string. \n  \n  \"XPC\" will report the XPC bits of the inventoried tag, if present, as a hex string. \n  \n  \"CRC\" will report the CRC bits of the inventoried tag as a hex string. \n\n\nBy default,\n“SIMPLE” mode does not report any additional meta data, “PORTAL” and “CONVEYOR” modes reports “ANTENNA”, and “INVENTORY” mode reports “ANTENNA”, “RSSI”, and “SEEN_COUNT”.\n",
